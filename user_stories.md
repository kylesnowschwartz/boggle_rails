# Single Player MVP
As a user:
    - I want to make a new game
        - so that I can play more than 1 game
    - I want to see the board clearly
        - so that I can easily make many words
    - I want to submit all my words at the same time
        - so that I can save time
    - I want to see the timer clearly
        - so I will be motivated to go quickly and use my time wisely
    - I want my words to be checked at the end of the game
        - so that I only get points for legitimate words
    - I want my score to be tallied automatically
        - so that I can save time and energy for more games
    - I want to see what words I missed
        - so that I can learn and improve for future games
